This is essentially a copy of my person ~/bin directory. It contains all sorts of little scripts that I've written at one time or another. I assert that all of it worked at one time. For some purpose or other. The only reason it's on github is as a backup.

This is in general NOT production code. There are however a couple exceptions to that.

playrandom and its aliases playonce playmeonce playme, and the GUI script which calls them, xmmssearch.sh, are in use daily.

Dontcatchfire.sh is also technically in use daily, but whatever. 

Documentation is sparse to non-existant, in contrast to dependancies, which are abundant.
